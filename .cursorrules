## Development

Run `npm run build` to build the plugin to verify it works.

## Important Rules

1. After any code changes, always run `npm run build` to:
   - Check for compilation errors
   - Ensure the plugin can be properly bundled
   - Verify there are no TypeScript type errors
   - Generate the updated main.js file
